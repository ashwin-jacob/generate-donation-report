# Generate Donation Report

This application has been made to combine information from membership and donation module in [Church Windows](http://www.churchwindows.com/). 

I will include information later on how to create the CSV files needed to run the report. If you are familiar with Church Windows, they you will need to generate CSV reports from membership and donation module. Make sure that the Membership CSV includes name, address, city state, and indv #. For the donation module, make sure it includes the giver name and **total** amount.

I created this using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)(formerly known as ATMOS).

## Run
If you would like to run the generated code, then you can do by installing electron through npm.

`npm install electron -g`

`cd /path/to/git`

`electron . `
